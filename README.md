Challenge: Interactive Form Validation
 
-- Task 1: HTML Form Structure
   Create an HTML form with the following fields:

   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Password
   - Confirm Password
   - Submit Button

-- Task 2: CSS Styling
   Style the form to make it visually appealing. Use CSS to:

   - Apply a responsive layout.
   - Style the form fields, labels, and buttons.
   - Add appropriate spacing and alignment.

-- Task 3: JavaScript Validation
   Write JavaScript code to perform the following validations 
   when the user submits the form:

   - Full Name:
     Should not be empty.
     Should contain only alphabets and spaces.

   - Email Address:
     Should not be empty.
     Should be a valid email address format.

   - Password:
     Should not be empty.
     Should have a minimum length of 8 characters.

   - Confirm Password:
     Should match the entered password.

-- Task 4: Display Validation Results
   Display appropriate error messages next to the form fields if the validation fails. 
   Use different styles (colors, icons) to distinguish between various validation results.

-- Task 5: Additional Features (Optional)
   Implement additional features to enhance the challenge:

   Real-time validation (validate as the user types).
   Show/hide password functionality.
   Use CSS transitions/animations to provide a smoother user experience.

-- Guidelines:
   Use vanilla JavaScript (es6+, no external libraries or frameworks).
   Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
   Bonus points for a responsive design.
